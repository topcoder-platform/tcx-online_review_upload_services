
Final Fix 3:
 * I added all test cases to submission, now they all execute successfully (see the test log). Thank you for your cooperation.

Here is list of changes I made:

Final Fix 2:
Point 4.1.2: added @version 1.1 tag to DefaultUploadServices#uploadSubmission

Point 6.1.1: I could not compile the accuracy tests,
             as for failure test they should work now, but you will need to add 'Specification Submission' ResourceRole to
             com.cronos.onlinereview.services.uploads.failuretests.MockResourceManager#getAllResourceRoles and also
             please note that this component uses logging wrapper 1.2 which requires namespace "com.topcoder.util.log"
             to be present in ConfigManager, you can use my logging.xml file.

Final Fix 1:
Point 1.1.1:
 * InvalidProjectPhaseException is thrown when Specification Submission phase is not opened.
 * Modified submitter role to 'Specification Submitter'
 * Corrected log message in DefaultUploadExternalServices#uploadSpecification
 * Designer confirmed that current upload type is correct, see thread: http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=680986&start=0&mc=4

Point 1.1.2: Please confirm that the submission compiles in Java 1.5.

Point 3.1.2: Log removed from uploadSpecification, I leave that in the rest of methods which
             were not in the scope of this competition.

Point 3.1.3:
 * First return statement has been removed.
 * Refractored:
   - close statement in DefaultUploadExternalServices#createNewFile
   - refractored both finding SubmissionType and SubmissionStatus

Point 3.1.4: Corrected userId conversion to string

Point 3.1.5: Corrected log message

Point 4.1.2: Not exactly know what you mean by: "DefaultUploadServices#uploadSubmission, you should add version tag" 
      - the version tag should be added only to classes and interfaces

Point 4.1.3:
 * Corrected comment
 * Added documentation for DefaultUploadServices#namespace field.

Point 5.1.2:
 * Added comment in CS.

Point 5.1.3:
 * Corrected assertions in all test method created during this contest, I didn't modify the previous ones

Point 6.1.1:
 * TODO?
